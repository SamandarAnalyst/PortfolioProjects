Title: Data Analytics Project

Description:
Welcome to my data analytics project repository. This project showcases my skills in SQL, Tableau, Python, Excel, and Power BI, with a focus on data cleaning, exploration, visualization, correlation analysis, and data visualization. The projects utilize real-world datasets like COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations.

Components:

SQL Project: Data Cleaning and Exploration

Description: In this project, I perform data cleaning and exploration using the "coviddeath.xlsx" and "covidvaccination.xlsx" datasets. SQL queries are utilized to clean the data, handle missing values, and perform basic exploratory analysis.

Tableau Project: Data Visualization

Description: The Tableau project focuses on creating insightful visualizations based on the cleaned COVID-19 datasets. Interactive dashboards and visualizations are developed to provide a comprehensive view of key metrics and trends.

Python Project: Correlation Analysis

Description: This project demonstrates correlation analysis using Python. The cleaned datasets are used to calculate correlations between various variables, and the results are visualized using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.

Excel Project: Data Cleaning

Description: The Excel project involves cleaning and preprocessing the atasets. Excel functions, formulas, and techniques are employed to handle data inconsistencies, remove duplicates, and prepare the data for analysis.

Power BI Project: Data Visualization

Description: The Power BI project focuses on creating dynamic and visually appealing data visualizations using the example datasets. Interactive reports and dashboards are built to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data and its trends.
